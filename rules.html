    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <P>
        You are lost in a magical maze full of creatures
        Battle monsters and collect coins and food to make your way out of the maze
    </P>
    <p>
        Every time you reach a crossroad you will be given a choice to go one of three ways
        <ul>
            <li>Forward</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>Left</li>
        </ul>
        Once you go down a road you will lose one food but you can also regain food along the way depending on what path is taken
        Watch out if you lose all of your food the game ends
    </p>
    <h2>Monster Battles</h2>
    <p>
        When battling monsters you can choose to kick, punch, or block and the monster will also choose one of the three.
        Keep in mind the following outcomes for each choice:
        <ul>
            <li>Kick beats Block</li>
            <li>Block beats Punch</li>
            <li>Punch beats Kick</li>
        </ul>
        If you win you will advance to the next crossroad
        If you lose you will lose a heart and be sent back to the last crossroad
    </p>
