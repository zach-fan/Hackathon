*monsters*
Goblin #1
As you pass through the dungeon, you smell an awful stench. You slink closer only to find a solitary goblin finishing up a drum stick. when he sees you throws it aside and prepares to make your bones into plaster.
Goblin #2
As you make it into the next room a goblin who looks like the Mike Tyson of the goblin world, but with a lot more flab and a lot less skills. After noticing you, he graces you with his very unprofessional fighting style.
Goblin #3
Right as you set off you immediately hear what sounds like a pack of hungry wolves. Instead it is a goblin near a mirror having an arguement with his reflection in na language that is somehow more animal like than actual animals. Unfortunately, while you were 
contemplating how a creature this dumb could have existed in a dangerous maze like this for so long the goblin whirls around and makes it clear to you that instead of going to school this goblin was lifting weights and doing boxing.

Goblin Win
You defeat the foul goblin and continue on your way. Good Job!

Goblin loss
After get absolutely trounced by the goblin you barely manage to take it down. You have lost one life.


Snake #1
You are crossing into the next when you hear a rattle. You try to run but the snake that was in the room follows you and prepares to pump your blood so full of venom that it will be classified as a biohazard postmortem.
Snake #2 
You come upon a room that has such a dense tangle of wood that you can barely see the walls. As you pass by a part that appears to be covered in a green ooze, a king cobra's head peeks through the thicket to the right. If it wasn't trying to kill you it might
have seemed majestic
Snake #3
After carefully manuvering around the spike traps and the swinging blade pendulum's you sit down to take a bite out of your rations. However, you quickly jump up and prepare to fight before the nearby 6-foot long snake takes a bite out of you.

Snake Win
After wrestling the snake and beating it to a pulp, you continue on your journey.

Snake loss
You are able to take the life of the snake, but the venom from it's bite trickles into your bloodstream and makes you lose one life.


Orc #1
An earth-shattering roar splits your eardrums as an orc barricades your path. You sigh and prepare for a battle.
Orc #2
You begin to salivate at the mouth as you smell an arouma similar to smoked pork. You rush towards the smell all caution thrown aside. You turn a corner and run into the room only to find an orc cooking what appears to be the last  adventurer that came by.
In heart, you know that you must avenge the adventurer's death and fight this orc, as well as realizing you can't progress in the game without defeating it.
Orc #3
As you pass into the next room your heightened warrior sense catches sight of an orc trying to sneak behind by holding a tree in front of him. The plan would have worked except for the fact that the tree was muich to small, it is a dungeon almost 
totally devoid of plant life except for moss, and the fact that trees don't move. You are so shocked by the absurdity of the plan that you almost don't catch him attempting to crush your skull.

Orc Win
You best the orc and after searching their pockets like a true adventurer, you move on to the next room

Orc loss
After being battered by the Orc, it slips and falls. allowing you to whail on it. You lost one life.
